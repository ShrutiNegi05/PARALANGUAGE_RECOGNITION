# Paralanguage Recognition for Virtual Connects

This project provides a real-time assistive system that detects emotions in individuals with cognitive or speech impairments using non-verbal cues like facial expressions, gestures, and voice tone.

## 🧠 Features
- Real-time emotion detection using CNN (for vision) and RNN (for voice tone)
- ISL (Indian Sign Language) gesture recognition
- Automatic caregiver alert when stress is detected
- Passive detection during virtual communication

## 📁 Repository Structure
